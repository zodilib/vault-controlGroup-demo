    "This setup is tested on MacOS and is meant to simulate a distributed setup. The components used in this demo are:\n",
    "- Vault Enterprise installed on docker (to simulate an external Vault)\n",
    "- You have the Vault CLI installed\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumes your Vault server is installed using docker and already running on http://127.0.0.1:8200\n",
    "and you have set your `VAULT_ADDR` and `VAULT_TOKEN` variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements to Run This Demo\n",
    "You will need Visual Studio Code to be installed with the Jupyter plugin. To run this notebook in VS Code, chose the Jupyter kernel and then Bash.\n",
    "- To run the current cell, use Ctrl + Enter.\n",
    "- To run the current cell and advance to the next, use Shift+Enter."
